## usage example:
# Initialize system
vio = WorldModelAPI(calib_params)
vio.start()

# Add sensor data
vio.add_stereo_frame(left_image, right_image)
vio.add_imu_data(gyro_data, accel_data)

# Get navigation state
state = vio.get_navigation_state()
print(f"Position: {state['position']}")
print(f"Velocity: {state['velocity']}")

# Get obstacle map for path planning
obstacle_map = vio.get_obstacle_map(local_only=True)
